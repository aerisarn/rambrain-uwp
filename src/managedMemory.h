 * @note Different strategies which elements to swap out / in can be implemented by inheriting this class
 * @note End users do not need to instantiate/use this class directly. This will be done by config manager
 *
 * This class's implementation is written to standardize most of interactions between swap and managedMemory derived classes.
 * Implementation supports asynchronous actions. While there may be more parallelism possible we currently
 * support only one mutex ( stateChangeMutex ) to make this thread-safe to keep things simple at the moment.
 * @warning When writing new strategies, study the locking/unlocking of stateChangeMutex closely to prevent deadlocks. ManagedFileSwap may serve as an example.

/** \brief manages all managed Chunks of raw memory
 *
 * This object tracks the dimesions and status of a chunk of memory we manage.
 * The status is inherently connected to the logic we can operate on the object and
 * it is basically prescribed what classes may change the status from wich state to which.
 * Even though it would be more clear to have convenience and thread-safe functions here,
 * we decided for this due to performance issues. More documentation to come. The basically
 * possible transitions are depicted in the following graph:
 * \dotfile chunkStatusScheme.dot
 * @note when changing status, you have to hold the stateChangeMutex of the associated memoryManager
 * @warning There may be changes to any objects status when calling waiting functions in managedMemory or managedSwap.
 * Thus the user has to check the status of the object again having called such functions or having freshly acquired the lock
